# About Me
#### A Brief Synopsis

I have always been curious about technology. The first code I ever wrote was a bash script that loaded Linux onto an old macbook. Ever since I got that to work, I have been intrigued by being able to get computers to do what I want them to.

I enjoy software development, particulary areas around computer networking and information security. When I'm not building web apps I'm secretly trying to hack into dummy wifi networks with a Raspberry Pi.

Generally, I want to contribute to a world that places value on public good and open access to technology over growth and profit. For me, software development is a tool I can use to help contribute to that future.
