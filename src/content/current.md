#### What am I up to now?

Although bash scripts and wifi hacks got me into programming, apart from some spare time spent on Hack the Box, I am primarily focused on web development at the moment. I enjoy using Next.js and TypeScript, so the t3 stack has been my area of exploration recently. I am in the process of building an e-commerce template using those technologies with the intention of sharing it as an open source template.

This portfolio site is something I've been working on for a little while now, only recently publishing it as I feel it's more or less ready, apart from some styling left to do. The process of creating a personal site is something I revisit every so often because I feel it is an expression of self, and my "self" is constantly changing, so shouldn't how I express my "self" change too? Is this too deep of a conversation for my website bio? Who am I even talking to? These are the questions that keep me up at night. Perhaps I can ask my all knowing friend. Click the brain to find out what I'm talking about.
