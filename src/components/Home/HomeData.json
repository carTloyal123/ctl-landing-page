        "Hi! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Carson! I'm a Software Engineer.",

        "I have been writing software for 8 years. I started writing code with the introduction of Swift in 2014 and never looked back. I went on to study Mechanical Eningeering and used MATLAB extensively for modeling and simulation. My post-graduate studies led me to C++/Python with programming of autonomous vehicles in path planning, localization, and controls. My proffessional experience has centered around C# and the Unity game engine as well as C++ under the ROS robotics framework. Outside of work, I have explored Java and Kotlin as well as Javacript and Typescript for home automation, reverse engineering, and backend development.",

        "I like solving problems that make people's lives better and more efficient. I am passionate about learning new technologies and sharing my knowledge with others. I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow."
